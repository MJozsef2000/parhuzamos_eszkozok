# Repository for "párhuzamos eszközök" course at Miskolci Egyetem + MultipleLoader
This repository is for my school work and school project, which consists of a custom
made API to handle OpenCL tasks easier. The development of this project is 
at amateur levels and should be taken at face value, it is just merely a concept.

The main goal of the project was for me to get closer to the OpenCL standard,
while also making a more user friendly API for my peers to use during this course.
